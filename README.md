# Burger Eats - Cypress Automation Project

## ðŸ“– Overview

This project was developed to **practice and improve test automation skills** using **[Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/)** and the **Page Object Model (POM)** design pattern.

The automated tests validate the **sign-up workflow** for the **Burger Eats** web application, from opening the form, filling in user data, and submitting it, to verifying validation messages and **ViaCEP API** integration for automatic address completion.

In addition to the automation scripts, a **manual test case sheet** was created to complement the testing process:

## ðŸŽ¯ Project Goals

- Strengthen Cypress skills and understanding of modern E2E testing practices  
- Implement **Page Object Model (POM)** for clean, maintainable test structure  
- Practice **test data management** using factory patterns  
- Explore **mocking external APIs** (ViaCEP) with `cy.intercept()`  
- Validate **form behavior** for positive and negative scenarios
